  "body": "# Welcome to the Timelapse Project!\r\n\r\nThe Timelapse Project is the open source hardware and software project which is made to create dynamic time-lapse videos.\r\n\r\nUsing this instructions you should be able to make the device yourself. If after reading the instructions something remains unclear please ask, I will be happy to answer or correct this instructions.\r\n\r\nTo make the device you would need:\r\n\r\n1. WeMos D1 or WeMos D1 mini controller\r\n1. A stepper motor driver board\r\n1. A stepper motor\r\n1. A ballhead camera mount\r\n1. A rigid box\r\n1. Tools to make a hole in the box and mount the stepper motor inside the box\r\n1. Wires\r\n1. 2 leds of different colours\r\n1. An infra red led\r\n1. Resistors to limit current which is going through leds\r\n1. If you buy the controller boards without pre soldered pins you would need soldering gun, solder and alcohol (or something else to clean the soldering parts). \r\n\r\nAll this stuff could be bought from Chinese web stores and delivered to you by post service.\r\n\r\nBasically all you need to do to create a hardware part of the device is to connect pins using wires. In the WeMos board you will find a number of pins. Most of the pins are programmable and have a positive polarity. These are pins which are using in the project:\r\n\r\n- D7. - IR led for controlling the camera\r\n- D1. - The led which indicates that the wifi communication was established between the device and the wifi point;\r\n- D6. - The led which indicates that the power is on and the software is working;\r\n- D2, D4, D3, D5. - Pins to controll the stepper motor. This pins should be connected to the stepper motor driver board.\r\n\r\nAll leds should be connected to pins via resistor to limit current.\r\nTo calculate a resistor value Ohm law could be used. Let's say we have a led and it can handle 20 mA current. Then:\r\n\r\nby the Ohm law V = I * R\r\n\r\nthat means R = V / I\r\n\r\n3.5 / (20 / 1000) = 175 ohm\r\n\r\nIt is not nessesary to use a resistor with the exact value. But the value should not be lower then calculated value because the lifetime of led will be reduced. And the value shold not be much higher because the led will be glowing dimmer.\r\n\r\nAlso mind the polarity. Ground pins of the WeMos controller should be connected to the leds minus (cathode), and pins D1, D6 and D7 to the leds plus (anode).\r\n\r\nMost probably the way of connecting stepper motor driver board will be very straightforward. If not check the information about your driver in the internet. \r\n\r\n1. It should have 4 input pins - this inputs should be connected to the pins D2, D4, D3, D5 of WeMos D1. \r\n1. It should have 2 DC power supply inputs\r\n1. It should have 4 output contacts to be connected to the stepper motor.",
